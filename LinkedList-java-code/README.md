# Singly Linked List Operations - Java Mini Project

## Problem Statement

You are required to implement a **Singly Linked List** in Java to perform the following operations:

1. **Initialize** a linked list with a single node having the value `10`.  

2. **Add nodes** to the linked list with the following values in sequence:  
   - 200  
   - 30  
   - 40  
   - 50  

3. **Print the linked list** to display all node values in order.  

4. **Delete a node** with the value `30` from the linked list.  

5. **Print the updated linked list** after the deletion.  

6. **Replace a node value**: Replace the node with value `200` by `999`.  

7. **Print the final linked list** to reflect the changes.  

### Requirements:

- Use a **custom `SinglyLinkedList` class** to create and manage the linked list.  
- Implement methods to **add nodes**, **delete nodes**, and **replace node values**.  
- Traverse the linked list using a **while loop** to print the list after each operation.  
- Ensure the program correctly handles **all operations in sequence** and displays the output as expected.

### Expected Operations Sequence:

```text
Initial List: 10 -> 200 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50
After Deleting 30: 10 -> 200 -> 40 -> 50
After Replacing 200 with 999: 10 -> 999 -> 40 -> 50
