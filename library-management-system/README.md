# University Library Management System - Mini Project

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a **Library Management Program** in Java that manages a collection of books using a custom linked structure and a HashMap. The program should perform the following operations in sequence:  

1. Add 5 books to the collection with unique IDs and names:  
   - 501 → "OS"  
   - 502 → "CN"  
   - 503 → "JAVA"  
   - 504 → "OPTML"  
   - 505 → "DMML"  

2. Print the complete list of books in **ordered view** using a loop.  

3. Remove books from the list in sequence, including:  
   - Removing the first book (head of the list)  
   - Removing a book by its index in the list  

4. After each removal, display the updated list of books.  

5. Finally, display the **total count of books** remaining in the list.  

You are required to:  

- Use a **custom linked list structure** (`List` class) to maintain the order of books.  
- Use a **HashMap** to store book records in the form `<Id, BookName>`.  
- Implement methods to **loop through the list**, **remove items**, and **count total books**.
